# Rate My Project: Dribble for Developers

As users, developers will be able to showcase their projects (using GitHub repos) with information on their functioning,
possibly alongside GIFs/videos of their functioning. They can assign existing users of the app to rate and review their
projects on various metrics. They can also invite their family/friends via email/text messages to come and check out their
projects and leave feedback or suggest changes.

- To motivate users to review projects from fellow developers, scores will be assigned to individual users and their
corresponding accounts and the higher the score of a user, the more weight their rating will carry in the
community.
- By default, a logged-in user will have the ability to post their projects and other users with similar skill set will be
able to see and review them.
- The website will also contain sections with logistics, such as - highly rates projects, most active reviewers, the
reviewers with the highest scores etc.

Ultimately, this will be an app along the lines of StackOverflow where like-minded developers can connect and help each
other improve via constructive feedback and words of advice. These projects will also be publicly available in a more
streamlined way so that aspiring developers looking for help with their own projects can find everything in this site without
setting out on a grand time-consuming Google search to find the info they are looking for.
